Matrix tree theorem directed graphs

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with no paths:
    This is always Z_n.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with one path:
    This is always trivial.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with two paths:
    Possible way of generalization: prove that two paths always use up all
    available higher invariant factors

    Invariant factor depends only on number of zeroes clockwise of the
    counter-clockwise path and counter-clockwise of the clockwise path.
    The other ends of these paths can grow or shrink, and it will not
    change the invariant factor.  The invariant factor produced is always
    >[REDO]< where x is the number of zeroes in that section between the paths.

    It does also seem to not matter if the inside of this path is broken up be zeroes.
    This means that the inside of these paths can be anything as long as the
    cc paths and the c paths do not cross.

Invariant factors of Jacobian of cycle graphs with more than two paths:
    This refers to any configuration that are not covered by the two paths configurations.
    The only factors that I have noticed for these paths is Z_2 and the trivial group.

Wheel graphs:
    Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=2) inv factors followed Z_(2^(size-1)-1) x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=1) inv factors followed Z_(size-1) x Z

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=1) same as Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=1)

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=2) same as Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=2)

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=0) inv factors followed
        .27555(golden_ratio^{x}) x 5*.27555(golden_ratio^{x}) x Z for odd sizes
    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=0) inv factors followed
        .618035(golden_ratio^{x}) x .618035(golden_ratio^{x}) x Z for even sizes

    Sequence of numbers starting with 0:4, 1:3 if the index of the next number in the sequence (n) is even,
    the next number S(n) = 5*S(n-1) - S(n-2).  If n is odd then S(n) = S(n-1) - S(n-2).
    Jacobian values are: Z_(S(n)) x Z_(S(n)) for even n and Z_(S(n)) x Z_(5*S(n)) for odd n

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=1) inv factors followed Z_(n-1) x Z_(n-1) X Z for even sizes
    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=1) inv factors followed Z_((n-1)/2) x Z_((n-1)*2) X Z for odd sizes

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=2) =>[similar to]<= Graph.wheel(size, direction=0, spoke_direction=0) [second is times 4 NOT times 5]

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=2, spoke_direction=0) same as Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=2)

    Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=0) same as Graph.wheel(size, direction=1, spoke_direction=2)


Check for pattern un P, Q in PAQ = Smith when growing P and Q to fit larger cycles.  Maybe check for pattern
in growing smith itself or growing laplacian

Check 4, 6, 8 ... paths for cyclic graphs to determine if they all have Z ... Z_n invariant factors

directed matrix tree theorem
proving cycle graphs by splitting laplacian between paths


Clear central diagonal by adding element of diagonal upwards and downwards.  This allows previous element in diagonal
to be able to freely clear its column since its entire row is now clear.  By definition, any bidirectional edges in
the diagonal have to have one -1 above or below it.  By only clearing the 1's first, all the 2's will be made into
ones by the time the first sweep has completed.  The new 1's can then clear their columns since their rows had
already been cleared, converting more 2's if there are any adjacent.  This results in a prefect identity matrix.

For even wheel graphs: arbitrary picard groups of wheel graphs of size n appear to be Z_{(n-1)*a} x Z where a is in the picard group
of cycle graph n-1 Z_a X Z when all spokes point outward

When odd and n-1 is a multiple of 4, the wheel picard is Z_{(n-1)*a} x Z
When odd and n-1 is not a multiple of 4, Z_2 x Z_{(n-1)/2*a} x Z


Slide recommendations

mark theorems and conjectures.

Explain meaning of invariant factors, more pictures, less explanation.

Computer many examples and noticed patterns.  Proved later.

Directed Matrix tree theorem for tree.  Reason jac is trivial.

Laplacian represents more general framework.  Reason for looking at directed case

second set of more detailed slides

multiplied invariant factors are pairs.  Represent different groups of combinations of equiv classes



Revised wheel graphs: if the size of the cycle graph is prime the jacobian is Z_{(n-1)*a} x Z where a is in the picard group
of cycle graph n-1 Z_a X Z when all spokes point outward.  Sometimes wheel Jacobian is made up of multiple factors.
Check if that is governed by any known rules of invariant factor multiplication.  This seems to happen for every multiple of
the prime factors of a
