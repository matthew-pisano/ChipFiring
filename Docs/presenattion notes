sub sections to sub graphs on slide 7
mention that undirected graphs are always strongly connected -> all edges bidirectional

picard group is group on slide 10.  Can add and subtract vectors
equivalence class not equivalency

mention that picrard group is finitley generated ableian group.  Jacobian is torsion subgroup. can genrate group from basic classes

slide 11 not rank, integers to the power of rank

slide 14 not strongly connected, layers directionally connected

slide 18 jacobian of tree is also proven using induction.  Jacobian never changes always trivial.  Not matrix tree theorem

slide 20 show slide 21 (picture) first.  Split data into another slide after cycle graph text

slide 22 show picture first


slide 7 emphasize usefulness of terminal strong components.  Only appears in directed graphs.

slide 8 and 9 linear algebra is useful to dresvie games.  Writing things in vectors facilitates this therefore divisors

slide 9 equiv relation useful because it helps to generalize similar divisors that can be gotten form one another

slide 10 lending and borroing moves do not changes chips, reason why we can describe degree of eq class and divisors.  Jacobian is useful beacuse it is torsion subgroup.  Splitting off Jabobian makes picard group computation easier

slide 12 size is ambiguous.  Number of vertices.  Combuting picard bgoup from snf.  Reason for using linear algrabe to describe

describe paths in sepaerate slide.

Get ride of fnding picard gorup in title

fix arrangelemt of last slides

make conjedtures and theorems more obvious.  More like headings.  More like textbook

work on cue cards or something similar

slide 11 structure of picard grouo comes from abelina structure theorem
