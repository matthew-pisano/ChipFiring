sub sections to sub graphs on slide 7
mention that undirected graphs are always strongly connected -> all edges bidirectional

picard group is group on slide 10.  Can add and subtract vectors
equivalence class not equivalency

mention that picrard group is finitley generated ableian group.  Jacobian is torsion subgroup. can genrate group from basic classes

slide 11 not rank, integers to the power of rank

slide 14 not strongly connected, layers directionally connected

slide 18 jacobian of tree is also proven using induction.  Jacobian never changes always trivial.  Not matrix tree theorem

slide 20 show slide 21 (picture) first.  Split data into another slide after cycle graph text

slide 22 show picture first
